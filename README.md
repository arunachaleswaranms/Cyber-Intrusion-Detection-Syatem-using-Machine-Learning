# Cyber Intrusion Detection System

This project is a Cyber Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed using machine learning algorithms. The system is designed to detect network intrusions by distinguishing between normal and malicious network traffic.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arunachaleswaranms/Cyber-Intrusion-Detection-System.git
   cd Cyber-Intrusion-Detection-System

   updating......
2. **Install the dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. **Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts:**
